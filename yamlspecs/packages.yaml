# bootstrap and system packages built/installed when "make bootstrap" is invoked

# All of these should be lists, see the build: example for yaml2rpm

# BOOTSTRAP
# Pre-reqs for building all packages. These packages are built, in order, and installed as they are built. 
bootstrap:

# SYSTEM
# Packages supplied by the OS vendor that must be installed prior to building anything in this admix
system:

# BUILD
# Packages that must be built in this admix
build:
   - yaml2rpm
   - rcic-module-support
   - rcic-module-path

# MANIFEST
# List of packages that would probably be installed on a generic target system
# This says the manifest is  all built packages. All built and all system packages is 
# another rational configuration

manifest:  
   - "{{ build }}"
