# bootstrap and system packages built/installed when "make bootstrap" is invoked

# BOOTSTRAP
# Pre-reqs for building all packages. These packages are built, in order, and installed as they are built. 
bootstrap:

# SYSTEM
# Packages supplied by the OS vendor that must be installed prior to building anything in this admix
system:
   - redhat-lsb-core
   - platform-python-devel

   
# BUILD
# Packages that must be built in this admix
build0:
   - yaml2rpm
   - rcic-module-support
   - rcic-module-path
build:
   - "{{build0}}" 
   - rcic-dev-repo


# MANIFEST
# List of packages that would probably be installed on a generic target system
# This says the manifest is  the {{build0}}. All built and all system packages is 
# another rational configuration
manifest:  
   - "{{build0}}"
   - environment-modules
