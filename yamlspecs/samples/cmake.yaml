    Cmake version {{version}}. CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, 
    test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple 
    platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces 
    that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created 
    by Kitware in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source 
    projects such as ITK and VTK.
  build:
    configure: ./bootstrap --prefix={{root}}
