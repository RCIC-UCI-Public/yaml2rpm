  description: >
    PyCogent version {{ version }}.
    PyCogent is a software library for genomic biology. It is a fully integrated and thoroughly 
    tested framework for: controlling third-party applications; devising workflows; querying databases; 
    conducting novel probabilistic analyses of biological sequence evolution; and generating publication 
    quality graphics. It is distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities 
    (such as true codon alignment) and the frequent addition of entirely new methods for the analysis of 
    genomic data.
