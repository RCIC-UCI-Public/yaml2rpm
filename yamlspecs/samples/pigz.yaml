    Pigz Parallel Gzip version {{ version }}. pigz, which stands for parallel 
    implementation of gzip, is a fully functional replacement for gzip that exploits 
    multiple processors and multiple cores to the hilt when compressing data. pigz was 
    written by Mark Adler, and uses the zlib and pthread libraries. To compile and use pigz,
