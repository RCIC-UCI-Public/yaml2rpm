# Get everything in before travel.  Rocks-roll is looking pretty good and
# can now build the os roll (centos with updates).  It looks like only the
# first CDROM of our os/centos roll is needed with 3 extra disks.
#
# - rocks-dist cleanup (tossed a ton of code)
# - rocks-roll growth (added 1/2 a ton of code)
# - bootable rolls do not work
# - meta rolls are untested
# - rocks-dist vs. rocks-roll needs some redesign but fine for 4.0.0
