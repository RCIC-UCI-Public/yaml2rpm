# - Buildroot is in localdir, this makes cleanup on failed RPM builds easier
# - Generated specfile has no %clean section
# - Makefile does clean instead
# - $(NAME).pkg is the RPM tree, you can check this before installing the RPM.
#   Same idea as the distN directory for rolls.
# - Theme is less like RPM, and simpler debugging

# The last change to prefix the wrapper tarball with an '_' works but is more
# invasive than required.  Instead we just exclude the symlink package name
# from the tarball and get the same result.  A simple one line change in just
# one file.  This also means all existing spec files should still work, so
# this change will not break CVS.
